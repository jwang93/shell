1. Fix the seg fault issue when calling jobs 
NEW PROBLEM:
	after i call a jobs command, the bg job just keeps going... 


2. Implement cd, fg, bg, jobs 
3. Code refactor 
4. Write the README 


NEW BUG:
	cmd: /bin/sleep 3 &
	cmd: /bin/ls 
	cmd: jobs 
	//everything works properly

	cmd: bin/sleep 3 &
	cmd: jobs 
	//everything gets broken, every new cmd just prints jobs 

	cmd: /bin/sleep 20 &
	cmd: /bin/ls 
	//you need to wait 20 seconds for the job to finish, it isn't executing in background 

	if a job is in bg, we need to actually run it in bg, we need to do more than just return the shell
