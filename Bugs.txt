Getting some QA Action going... 

1. When we finish a job, we need to kill it. For example, 
	command 1: /bin/ls -l  (works perfectly)
	command 2: /bin/ls (it will execute command 1 + 2; but otherwise, works perfectly)
	command 3: /bin/ls | /usr/bin/wc (it will executed command 1, 2, 3)

	I don't think that is what's supposed to happen right?
